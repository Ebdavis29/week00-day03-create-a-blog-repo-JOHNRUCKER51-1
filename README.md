# Create a Blog to Document Your Journey into Tech

## Overview

A big part of learning is being able to demonstrate what you've learned and telling others what it is that you've learned. 
In this digital world, blogs, [short for weblog](https://www.etymonline.com/word/blog#:~:text=blog%20%28n.%29%20%22online%20journal%2C%22%201998%2C%20short%20for%20weblog,from%20%28World%20Wide%29%20Web%20%28n.%29%20%2B%20log%20%28n.2%29.) whether full length articles on self hosted and cloud solutions tools like [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), or Custom solutions; hosted (micro) blogs like [Blogspot](https://www.blogger.com/about/), [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) and [X](https://twitter.com/); and distributed platforms like [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) and [Nostr](https://nostr.com/).

We'll get you started on your first blog. And the Stretch Goals will show you how to make and deploy a site of your own.

Head to our [SideQuests website: https://sidequests.onrender.com/](https://sidequests.onrender.com/) where you can find additional Computer Science resources, Career Guidance, and our Blogs.

## Setup and Documentation

The repo holding the code for the SideQuests is available [here](https://github.com/CodeCrew-CodeSchool/SideQuests).  

Clone the repo to your computer by using [Github Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/setting-up-github-desktop), you can use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) or the [git command line program](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as well.

Use these resources to get going:

- [Blog Instructions](https://sidequests.onrender.com/Blog/2024/)

- [Growth Mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset)
    - The topic for your first post, once you configure your blog folder 
  
- [Markdown on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
    - How to write and format Markdown files that display nicely as a web page.


## Requirements

[Following the steps](https://sidequests.onrender.com/Blog/2024/), you'll have met the following requirement for your Blog.

1. Your site should exist at `[https://sidequests.onrender.com/Blog/2024/GITHUB_USERNAME](https://sidequests.onrender.com/Blog/2024/)`. Following the instructions at that link to set that up.
1. The "source" for your site should include an index.md or README.md file, written in Markdown, that gives a description of your blogsite. AND a 2nd .md file, where you will add your first blog post.
1. On your index page:
    - Prepare a welcome message to your blog along with a brief table of contents and a link to your Github page 
1. On your first post:
    - Explain "growth mindset" in your own words
    - Include 3 reminders to yourself of how to keep yourself in a growth mindset
1. Utilize at least 5 different features of Markdown to structure your README page and any HTML element you feel may help


### Stretch Goals

1. Beef up your github profile page! Add an image, a bio, contact info... as much as you feel comfortable including. Any styles applied to a README.md file in a repo that has the same name as your Username will be automatically displaced like a banner when people visit your Github Profile.
    - Remember, these pages will be a showcase of your developer skills, so make it look great! Check out some samples from earlier cohorts below:
    - [Conner's Profile](https://github.com/connerkT/)
    - [Molly's Profile](https://github.com/MollyAP/)
    - [Tiana's Profile](https://github.com/TianaD/)
      
1. Give yourself an additional learning challenge by tackling the bonus stretch goal of having full control over the styling and url of your own blog site by publishing a [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) web site from your own custom repo.
    - Be sure to make a link on your SideQuests Blog repo to help people be able to find your work. 



# Submission Instructions
